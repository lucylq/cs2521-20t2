# Week 7 Tutorial: Graphs

Welcome back! :)

## Graphs Review
- Definitions, terminology

## Reachability
- Is a vertex u reachable from a vertex v?

## Djikstra's
- Shortest path from vertex V to every other (reachable) node in the graph

## Minimum Spanning Tree
- A set of edges from the graph that:
    - connects all the vertices together, without cycles
    - minimizes total edge weight
    - Applications in circuitry, networking, water systems, etc.
- Kruskal's (sort edges)
- Prim's (greedy)
- Both will give an MST, not necessarily unique

## Graph Problems
- See github, coming soon.

## Assignment 2
Groupwork
- Find a group: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ra9ubqMBCiwpcGWaY2fzajqo038OARlxZjfi0YbptVU/edit?usp=sharing
- Organise regular meetings, keep everyone involved. 
- Peer Assessment

Assignment
- Part 1: Learn about the game
- Part 2: Implement the game view
- Part 3: Implement game players

Admin
- Gitlab repos will be organised this week
- Tournaments start in week 9
