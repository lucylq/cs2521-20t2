Pseudocode for djikstra's algorithm.

initialise: seen, dist, pred, queue

while (queue is not empty):
    node = dequeue (q)
    if (seen[node]) continue;
    seen[node] = true;
    for each child of node:
        if (dist to child via node < dist[child]):
            update dist[child]
            update pred[child]
        if (!seen[child])
            add child to queue
end while loop

dist: stores the length of the shortest path
pred: pred[node] stores the predecessor of that node. Backtrack through pred to find the path.
