## Differentiating sorting algorithms
- Stability

Input: (1, a) (2, a) (1, b) (3, z)
Stable: (1, a) (1, b) (2, a) (3, z)
Unstable: (1, b) (1, a) (2, a) (3, z)

- Time Complexity
- Space Complexity

## Sorting algorithms
- Bubble sort
- Insertion sort
- Merge sort
- Quick sort
- Shell sort

## Sort Detective
- Use the characteristics of different sorting algorithms to differentiate.
- Graph your results.
