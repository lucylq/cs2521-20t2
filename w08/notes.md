# Week 8 Tutorial: Hashing, Heaps, Tries

## Two sum problem
Given an array of integers A and a value V, can we find two numbers in that array that add up to V in time:
- O(n^2)?
- O(nlogn)?
- O(n)?

## Hash tables
- hash table: key value store
- hash function
- collision resolution
    - linked lists
    - linear probing
    - double hash
- resizing

## Heaps
- max heap (parent > child)
- min heap (parent < child)
- array representation
- fix up, fix down
- used in a priority queue

## Tries
- dictionary data structure
- insertion and lookup

## Assignment
- Poll
- Must use your private group Wiki

## Lab
- Please move into assignment groups. 
- Nanway and I will first move through each group, please show us your Wiki + GitHub repo
- Marking as normal
