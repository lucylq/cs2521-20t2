Have your code up in vscode / gedit!

Time Complexity and Space Complexity (how much memory is used)
Big-O notation

O(n): linear algorithm (list length, list mean, list sum, etc.)
O(n^2): quadratic algorithm (insertion sort from lab01)
O(2^n): fibonacci (for certain implementations)

n: input size
Asymptotic complexity
